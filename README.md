Everbody Votes

This is a web application made giving users the ability to create polls and votes based on their specific questions then allowing other users to vote and comment similar to a message board poll.

This is the frontend repo with React. The backend was made with Ruby on Rails in a separate repo.

This was made with React.js, HTML, styled with CSS, incorporating Chart.JS to display data on graphs.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
